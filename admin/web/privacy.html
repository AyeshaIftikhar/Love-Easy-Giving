    </p>
    <p>

        As described in this Privacy Notice, we may also share personal data relating to you with third parties who are
        located overseas, for business purposes and operational, support and continuity purposes, for example, when we
        use IT service providers or data storage services.
    </p>
    <p>
        Countries where personal data relating to you may be stored and/or processed, or where recipients of personal
        data relating to you may be located, may have data protection laws which differ to the data protection laws in
        your country of residence. By submitting your personal data, you accept that personal data relating to you may
        be transferred, stored or processed in this way. We take measures to ensure that any international transfer of
        information is managed carefully and in accordance with data protection law to protect your rights and interests

        protection for personal data;
        - We have obtained the consent of data subjects to the international transfer of
        their personal data;
        - Transfers within the Urbane Network Ltd Group where we have entered into Standard Contractual Clauses or an
        intra-group agreement, both of which give specific contractual protections designed to ensure that your personal
        data receives an adequate and consistent level of protection wherever it is transferred within the Group;
        - Transfers to organisations where we are satisfied about their data privacy and
        security standards and protected by contractual commitments such as signing the Standard Contractual Clauses
        and, where available, further assurances such as certification schemes; and
        - if transferred to the United States of America, the transfer will be to organizations that are part of the
        Privacy Shield.
    </p>
    <p>
        You have the right to ask us for more information about our safeguards. Please contact the Data Protection
        Officer (see the Contact Us section at the beginning of this Privacy Notice).
    </p>
    <h4>
        7. Changes of Business Ownership and Control

    </h4>
    <p>

        It may be that this business may be sold to new owners or board of control changes, however any such change
        will comply with the policy herein
    </p>
    <h4>
        8. Security and data retention

    </h4>
    <p>

        Unfortunately, the transmission of information and data via the internet is not completely secure. Although we
        will do our best to protect personal data relating to you, we cannot guarantee the security of such data
        transmitted to the App/Website; any transmission is at your own risk. Once we have received personal data
        relating to you, we use strict procedures and security features to try to prevent unauthorised access.
    </p>
    <p>

        We may, from time to time, expand, reduce or sell our business, and this may involve the transfer of certain
        divisions or the whole business to other parties. Personal data relating to you will, where it is relevant to
        any division so transferred, be transferred along with that division and the new owner or newly controlling
        party will, under the terms of this Privacy Notice, be permitted to use personal data relating to you for the
        purposes for which it was supplied by you.
    </p>
    <p>

        The security of personal data regarding you is a high priority. We take such steps as are reasonable securely
        to store personal data regarding you so that it is protected from unauthorised use or access, misuse, loss,
        modification or unauthorised disclosure. This includes both physical and electronic security measures. Examples
        include the use of passwords, locked storage cabinets and secured storage rooms. Other features include:
    </p>
    <p>

        - storing information on secured networks consistent with industry standards, which are only accessible by those
        employees who have special access rights to such systems;
        - using industry-standard encryption technologies when transferring or receiving personal data, such as SSL
        technology;
        - restrictions are placed on the electronic transfer of files;
        - our IT networks undergo regular necessary vulnerability testing to identify and remedy potential opportunities
        for unauthorised data access; and
        - robust management of boundary firewalls, access controls, malware protection and patch release processes
        towards protecting customer data.
    </p>
    <h5>
        Retaining your data
    </h5>
    <p>

        We will keep your personal data for as long as we have a relationship with you. Once our relationship with you
        has come to an end (e.g. following closure of your account or following a transaction</p> or your application
    for a product is declined or you decide not to go ahead with it, we will only retain your personal data for a period
    of time that is calculated depending on the type of personal data, and the purposes for which we hold that
    information.
    </p>
    <p>
        We will only retain information that enables us to:
    </p>
    <p>

        - maintain business records for analysis and/or audit purposes;
        - comply with record retention requirements under the law (for example, as required under legislation concerning
        the prevention, detection and investigation
        of money laundering and terrorist financing);
        - defend or bring any existing or potential legal claims;
        - maintain records of anyone who does not want to receive marketing from us;
        - deal with any future complaints
        regarding the services we have delivered;
        - assist with fraud monitoring; or
        - assess the effectiveness of marketing that we may have sent you.
    </p>
    <p>

        We have a retention policy which helps us ensure information is only held for the correct period. We then
        delete or de-identify your data. The retention period is generally linked to the amount of time available to
        bring a legal claim, which in many cases is six or seven years following closure of your account or following a
        transaction. We will retain your personal data after this time if we are required to do so to comply with the
        law, if there are outstanding claims or complaints that will reasonably require your personal data to be
        retained, or for regulatory or technical reasons. If we do, we will continue to make sure your privacy is
        protected.
    </p>
    <h4>
        9. Your rights
    </h4>
    <p>
        You have certain rights regarding your personal data. These include the rights to:
    </p>
    <p>
        - request a copy of the personal data we hold about you;
        - request that we supply you (or a nominated third
        party) with an electronic copy of the personal data that you have provided us with;
        - inform us of a correction to your personal data;
        - exercise your right to restrict our use of your personal data;
        - exercise your right to erase your personal data; or
        - object to particular ways in which we are using your personal data (such as automated decision making, or
        profiling (for example to help us decide what products and services would suit you best); or
        - understand the basis of international transfers of your data by us.
    </p>
    <p>
        Where we rely on our legitimate interests to obtain and use your personal data then you have the right to object
        if you believe your fundamental rights and freedoms outweigh our legitimate interests. Where processing is
        carried out based upon your consent, you have the right to withdraw that consent.
    </p>
    <p>
        Your ability to exercise these rights will depend on a number of factors and in some instances, we will not be
        able to comply with your request e.g. because we have legitimate grounds for not doing so or where the right
        does not apply to the particular data we hold on you.
    </p>
    <p>
        You should note that if you exercise certain of these rights we may be unable to continue to provide some or
        all of our services to you (for example where the personal data is required by us to comply with a statutory
        requirement, or is necessary in order for us to perform our contract with you).
    </p>
    <p>
        We ask that you contact us to update or correct your information if it changes or if the personal data we hold
        about you is inaccurate.
    </p>
    <p>
        Please contact the Data Protection Officer if you wish to exercise any of your rights
    </p>
    <p>
        If you have a concern about the way we are collecting or using personal data relating to you, we request that
        you raise your concern with us in the first instance. Alternatively, you can contact the Information
        Commissioner’s Office <a href="https://ico.org.uk/concerns/">at</a>

    </h4>
